# fed
Food Experimentation Device for precision feeding of mice. The system uses and Arduino processor, 
servo motor, IR beam detector, and data logger to log pellets taken. FED runs off battery. 

To build the system, see the hardware directory. 

To build the software, checkout the fed-arduino source directory. 
The libraries will need to be added to your Arduino IDE library directory 
(the default Arduino IDE library directories are ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/ in Mac or 
My Documents\Arduino\libraries\ in Windows).
Note: Updated versions of these libraries may be available by their authors but these are the ones we know work with FED. 
No modifications were made by us.

In the Arduino IDE, load fed-arduino and set the board to Arduino UNO.
