# FED
Food Experimentation Device (FED) is a system for measuring feeding in mice. FED uses an Arduino processor, 
servo motor, IR beam detector, and SD card to provide feeding records of pellets eaten by singly housed rodents. FED runs off of a battery, which allows it to be placed in colony caging or within other experimental equipment.

Please see the wiki page for more information, including build instructions: https://github.com/KravitzLab/fed/wiki/

The hardware directory contains the system schematics. 

The mechanical pieces can be found on TinkerCAD (https://www.tinkercad.com/users/69Zt0NRn4eA-katrina-nguyen).
The Arduino sketch to run FED is in fed-arduino.
